    <h2>MY THREE STRENGTHS</h2>
    <h3>FUTURE THINKER</h3>

    <img src="http://brightthinkers.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/action-oriented.png" width='150' /></td>
    <p>This means my mind loves to think and dream about the future. I think about what is possible, and not what is impossible. I like to imagine the life I'll have. What I will be able to do that I can't do now. I like to think about the important things
        in life, what they mean, and how they are connected to each other. I spend time thinking about ideas, not just facts. </p>
    <h5>HOW I CAN USE THIS STRENGTH</h5>
    <ul>PLAN FUTURE EVENTS </ul>
    <ul>CLEARLY THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO BE LATER ON</ul>
    <h3>COMPETING</h3>
    <img src="https://www.freeiconspng.com/uploads/compete-rank-popularity-icon-10.png" width='150' /></td>
    <p>I see many things in life as a game, and I feel great joy when I win. I also truly hate to lose because I'm always striving for first place. Every day I compete. Winning first place is my goal in any contest that I feel is worth my time. If there
        is no one to compete against, I compete against myself to do more or accomplish a goal faster or better. Because I hate to lose, I might get angry or upset. It does not matter if others think the contest is important. If I'm doing it, I want to
        be number one. </p>
    <h5>HOW I CAN USE THIS STRENGTH</h5>
    <ul>PUSH MYSELF TO DO THE BEST I CAN</ul>
    <ul>CHALLENGE MYSELF AND DISCOVER NEW THINGS</ul>
    <h3>CONFIDENCE</h3>
    <img src="http://www.oningroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Confidence.png" width='150' /></td>
    <p>This means I believe in myself and in what I can do. This helps me take on challenges to feel sure I can succeed. I am able to do things that others may not want to try. I don't have to be like everybody else, and I don't have to follow the rest of
        the crowd. </p>
    <h5>HOW I CAN USE THIS STRENGTH</h5>
    <ul>MOTIVATE MYSELF</ul>
    <ul>OVERCOME MY FEARS</ul>
